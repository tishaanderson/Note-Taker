## Description

As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks that I need to complete.

My goal is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Installation

If you do not already have [Express](https://expressjs.com/) listed as a dependency in your package.json file, you must first install the package by entering the following into the terminal: 

``````
npm install express
``````

## Usage

The app will be deployed using Heroku. When the app is initially opened, the user will be presented with a landing page with a link to the actual notes page. Once on the notes page, the user will see their previously saved notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note in the right-hand column. The user will be able to enter a title for each "New Note" along with the note's main body. Once a new note is started, the "Save Note" and "Clear Form" buttons will appear in the navigation at the top of the page.
